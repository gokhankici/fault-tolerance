#+INDEX: Analyzing Fault Tolerance for Erlang Applications

[[https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:213697/FULLTEXT01.pdf][Link]]

* Abstract

1. Process structure is extracted using static analysis (symbolic evaluation)
2. Check two important properties of the fault handling mechanism:
   1. Recovering from any process failure
   2. Not hiding any persistent errors

* Introduction

Dependability:

1. fault prevention
   - related to systems engineering
2. fault tolerance:
   1) Detect
   2) Diagnose
   3) Error recovery
      - backward recovery: restore to earlier error-free state
      - forward recovery: transform the erroneous state into an error-free one
      - compensation: erroneous state contains enough redundancy to calculate an
        error free state
3. fault removal
   - verification: it can be formal methods, code inspection, or testing
   - regression verification
4. fault forecasting
   - evaluation of the system by predicting the likelihood of a failure & its
     effect

*order:* prevention -> removal -> forecasting -> tolerance

*Erlang:* error detection through /linking/ processes

*fault injection*: to test the fault tolerance properties. even worse when the
system is distributed

** Problem

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Given a specific implementation of an Erlang application, automatically
determine the fault tolerance properties of that application.
#+END_QUOTE  

Questions:

1. which fault model? what type of faults? how to handle?
2. which properties of Erlang applications? 
   - e.g. how many times the system tries to recover before failing
3. what are the assumptions about the Erlang programs
4. what type of formal semantics to use as a model of Erlang and its env
5. how to analyze the programs

** Fault tolerance

*** Fault Models

- crash: entire system stops
- fail-stop: like crash, but the stopping of a subsystem is visible to other subsystems
- byzantine: subsystem may behave in any way (including malevolently)

|          | live        | not live  |
| safe     | masking     | fail safe |
| not safe | non-masking | none      |

- *non-masking:* after violating safety properties, returns to normal execution. 
  - soft real time systems: vast majority of tasks are handled correctly, a few
    may fail completely. 
  - e.g. telephone switching, four-nines availability (99.99%)

*** Model of distributed computation
